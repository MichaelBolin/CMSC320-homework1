What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

A merge takes changes from the branches that are being merged and combines them into a single commit, which is added
to the end of the target branch. The history of the merges is reflected as different branches off of the main branch,
which all reconverge back on the main branch. A rebase integrates any changes made in other branches by creating a 
new branch that first rewrites the commit history of the original branch, then appends the set of new commits on the
end of the new branch. The rebase method makes the commit history appear as a straight line of linear commits, rather
than a series of splits and merges.
